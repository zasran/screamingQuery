Screaming Query
===============

Lean mean screaming query engine (spell checker keeps suggesting streaming but what does the spell chequer know).

TODO:
  * add autotools files to build the project
  * add simple line reader (reads numbers or strings from a stream, one entry per line)
  * add simple aggregators like sum, average, maybe histogram for strings (plain text output)
